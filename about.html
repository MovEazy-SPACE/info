            <h2><span class="about-heading-highlight">|</span> Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2025 by three college innovators, MovEazy began with a simple idea—A smarter commercial real
                estate. We saw a major gap in the commercial real estate market; brokers had listings, businesses needed
                locations, but the right connections weren’t happening. We set out to make expansion effortless and real
                estate more valuable using data-driven insights to match properties with the businesses that will thrive
                there.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="about-heading-highlight">|</span> Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                At MovEazy, our mission is to redefine commercial real estate by making property transactions seamless,
                data-driven, and opportunity-focused. We believe that every commercial space has the potential to thrive
                with the right business, and we are here to make those connections happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                By empowering brokers with smarter tools, helping businesses find strategic locations, and simplifying
                the entire process, we bridge the gap between real estate and business growth. MovEazy isn’t just about
                listings—it’s about unlocking possibilities.
            </p>

            <h2><span class="about-heading-highlight">|</span> Our Vision</h2>
